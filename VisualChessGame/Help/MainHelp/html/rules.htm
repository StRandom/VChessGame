  The official rules of chess are maintained by the World Chess Federation. Along with information on official chess tournaments, the rules are described in the FIDE Handbook, Laws of Chess section.

<p><b>Setup</b></p>
Chess is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks and denoted with numbers 1 to 8) and eight columns (called files and denoted with letters a to h) of squares. The colors of the 64 squares alternate and are referred to as "light" and "dark" squares. The chessboard is placed with a light square at the right-hand end of the rank nearest to each player, and the pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo, with each queen on a square of its own color.

The pieces are divided, by convention, into white and black sets. The players are referred to as "White" and "Black", and each begins the game with 16 pieces of the specified color. These consist of one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns.

<p><b>Movement</b></p>
There are two players, one of which controls the white pieces and the other of which controls the black pieces. The player who controls the white pieces makes the first move then they take turns making moves. Pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play. With the sole exception of en passant, all pieces capture opponent's pieces by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies. When a king is in a square under attack, it is said to be in check. A player may not make any move that would put or leave his or her king in check. A player cannot "pass"; at each turn they have to make a legal move (this is the basis for the finesse called zugzwang). If the player to move has no legal moves, the game is over; it is either a checkmate (a loss for the player with no legal moves) if the king is under attack, or a stalemate (a draw) if the king is not.
Each player on his or her turn can make any move as long as it satisfies the following conditions:

It's a move of one of the following forms:
<p><b>Normal move</b></p>
A normal move is a move where a player moves one piece under the following conditions:
The piece he or she moves is the type of move for that type of piece which is as follows:
The king moves one square in any direction.
The rook can move any number of squares along any rank or file.
The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally.
The queen combines the power of the rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along rank, file, or diagonal.
The knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal, thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.
The pawn may move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file without capturing, or on its first move it may advance two squares along the same file without capturing (black "?"s in the diagram); or the pawn may capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, by moving to that square (black "x"s).
The piece stays the same type of piece unless it's a pawn moving to the 8th rank in which case it stays the same color and can get promoted to anything except a king. The promotion is not restriced to captured pieces. The pawn must get promoted if it reaches the 8th rank.
The piece may not go through another piece unless the former's a knight.
The piece captures a piece of the other color if it moves there but captures nothing if it moves to an empty square.
The piece may not move to a square with another piece the same color.

<p><b>Castling move</b></p>
A castling move is a move where the king moves 2 squares in a nondiagonal direction directly towards one of the rooks then that rook moves between where the king was before the move and where it is after the move, under the following conditions:
Neither the king nor the rook it's castling with ever moved before.
There are no pieces between the king and the rook it's castling with.
The rook the king is castling with never used to be a pawn.

<p><b>En passant move</b></p>
When a player moves a pawn 2 squares then on the very next move, the other player moves their pawn diagonally forward 1 square to the square that pawn moved through, capturing it in the process, the latter is said to be doing en passant. Note that the pawn does not move to the square of the pawn it captured in en passant.
A square is said to be under attack for one player when the other player has a move to that square satisfying the first condition.
He or she may not make a move that leaves or puts his or her king in check.
The king may not castle into check, out of check, or through check.

<p><b>Promotion</b></p>
Usually, the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen, but in some cases another piece is chosen; this is called underpromotion. In the diagram on the right, the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted to an allowed piece. There is no restriction placed on the piece that is chosen on promotion, so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game (for example, two queens).

<p><b>Check</b></p>
A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave his own king in check.
